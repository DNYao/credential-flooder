# Python Credential Flooder

*Here's the story:* One of my friends got hacked and their account messaged me a suspicious looking link. It looked like a link to a video but when I went to it to it, it was just a a fake messenger login page. I quickly wrote a python program that generates fake emails and passwords and sends them to the website to flood the scammers credential database. :)

You're free to use the source code, just change the url and xpath elements for selenium.

This project utilizes the *halo* and *selenium* python packages. You will also need the geckodriver for selenium. You can find the latest version here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

### Tell me if you want an official version. Otherwise, this is a just a fun little project.
